<h3 style="font-family:courier">Scientists Revive Microbes From 100 Million Years Ago</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana; ">Scientists have successfully revived microbes that had lain dormant at the bottom of the sea since the age of the dinosaurs, allowing the organisms to eat and even multiply after eons in the deep.

Their research sheds light on the remarkable survival power of some of Earth's most primitive species, which can exist for tens of millions of years with barely any oxygen or food before springing back to life in the lab.

A team led by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology analysed ancient sediment samples deposited more than 100 million years ago on the seabed of the South Pacific.

The region is renowned for having far fewer nutrients in its sediment than normal, making it a far-from-ideal site to maintain life over millennia.

The team incubated the samples to help coax the microbes out of their epoch-spanning slumber.

Astonishingly, they were able to revive nearly all of the microorganisms.

"When I found them, I was first sceptical whether the findings are from some mistake or a failure in the experiment," said lead author Yuki Morono.

"We now know that there is no age limit for (organisms in the) sub-seafloor biosphere," he told AFP.

URI Graduate School of Oceanography professor and study co-author Steven D'Hondt said the microbes came from the oldest sediment drilled from the seabed.

"In the oldest sediment we've drilled, with the least amount of food, there are still living organisms, and they can wake up, grow and multiply," he said.

Morono explained that oxygen traces in the sediment allowed the microbes to stay alive for millions of years while expending virtually no energy.

Energy levels for seabed microbes "are million of times lower than that of surface microbes," he said.

<h3>NASA releases stunning 1.8 billion-pixel photo of Mars</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana">This panorama of the Martian surface will leave you star-struck.

NASA released the largest and highest-resolution panorama the Curiosity rover has ever taken on Tuesday, and, at close to 1.8 billion pixels, it gives a hyper-realistic look at Mars. Composed of more than 1,000 images taken over the course of four days (between Nov. 24 and Dec. 1, 2019) — and assembled over subsequent months — the photo shows a region of Mars called “Glen Torridon,” according to a press release.

NASA Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada offers further insight into the image in a NASA-produced video, which has already racked up more than 530,000 views on YouTube. “Panoramas like this are like a window to another world,” says Vasavada, encouraging those interested to explore the image further in a 360-degree video.“While many on our team were at home enjoying turkey, Curiosity produced this feast for the eyes,” says Vasavada of the rover’s Thanksgiving photoshoot on the red planet. “This is the first time during the mission we’ve dedicated our operations to a stereo 360-degree panorama.”

The Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars for seven years, previously produced a 1.3 billion-pixel panorama in 2013.The photo, below, is interactive, and its high quality allows viewers to zoom in on distant aspects — including the rim of the crater the rover is inside of. Billions of years ago, the crater wasn’t a barren terrain but a lush landscape of lakes and streams, a fact scientists know from analysis of the area’s rock.

The image’s 360-degree perspective warps the image, NASA notes, giving it a fisheye lens-like perspective.
