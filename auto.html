<h3 style="font-family:courier">THE KOENIGSEGG GEMERA IS THE WORLD’S MOST WICKEDLY WEIRD HYBRID</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana; color:orange">Looking for a hybrid vehicle to help cut down on your carbon footprint? Can I suggest the new 1,700-horsepower Koenigsegg Gemera?

The mad Swedish supercar scientists at Koenigsegg are known for making ludicrous, limited-run, high-performance vehicles like the absurd 1,500-horsepower Regera, which was also a hybrid, or last year’s 300 mile per hour missile, the Jesko. But their latest creation, the Gemera, takes the absurdity to another level. And while, yes, it’s not going to make the same kind of dent in transportation emissions as, say, a Toyota Rav4 Hybrid, or a Chevy Volt, or any all-electric vehicle, it’s a fascinating piece of modern automotive technology.

The Gemera’s hybrid powertrain is made up of three electric motors and a three-cylinder combustion engine that Koenigsegg says runs on renewable alcohol fuel. (The company calls the three-cylinder engine the “Tiny Friendly Giant Engine.”) All four of these power units are clustered around the Gemera’s rear axle. But the supercar is still an all-wheel drive machine — Koenigsegg’s first — which the company accomplishes by using a direct drive system that runs from the rear of the car to the front axle.Koenigsegg calls it “the world’s first Mega-GT” (for Grand Tourer), and... sure. Like the company’s other cars, the Gemera is so ridiculous that it has license to pretty much call it whatever it wants. Most of us will never get a chance to drive one of the 300 that will be made, let alone consider buying something so rare. But it’s always fun to see what a group of people can do when they’re removed from the constraints that traditional automakers face.

<h3>One Of The Three Remaining Ford GT40 Prototypes Has Come Up For Sale</h3>
<p style="color:purple;font-family:verdana">This panorama of the Martian surface will leave you star-struck.

NASA released the largest and highest-resolution panorama the Curiosity rover has ever taken on Tuesday, and, at close to 1.8 billion pixels, it gives a hyper-realistic look at Mars. Composed of more than 1,000 images taken over the course of four days (between Nov. 24 and Dec. 1, 2019) — and assembled over subsequent months — the photo shows a region of Mars called “Glen Torridon,” according to a press release.

NASA Curiosity project scientist Ashwin Vasavada offers further insight into the image in a NASA-produced video, which has already racked up more than 530,000 views on YouTube. “Panoramas like this are like a window to another world,” says Vasavada, encouraging those interested to explore the image further in a 360-degree video.“While many on our team were at home enjoying turkey, Curiosity produced this feast for the eyes,” says Vasavada of the rover’s Thanksgiving photoshoot on the red planet. “This is the first time during the mission we’ve dedicated our operations to a stereo 360-degree panorama.”

The Curiosity rover, which has been on Mars for seven years, previously produced a 1.3 billion-pixel panorama in 2013.The photo, below, is interactive, and its high quality allows viewers to zoom in on distant aspects — including the rim of the crater the rover is inside of. Billions of years ago, the crater wasn’t a barren terrain but a lush landscape of lakes and streams, a fact scientists know from analysis of the area’s rock.

The image’s 360-degree perspective warps the image, NASA notes, giving it a fisheye lens-like perspective.
