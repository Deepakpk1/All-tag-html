<h3>Fans Are Running Wild With PS5's God Of War Sequel</h3>
<p style="color:purple;font-family:verdana"> Fans of the popular and long-running video game series God of War have been eagerly awaiting any news about the next game in the franchise and, at the PS5 showcase event, they got their wish as God of War: Ragnarok was announced.
Details are still scarce for the sequel at the moment with the news not long announced, but we will keep updating this page with information as and when we get it – and we hope we get more soon as our excitement levels are high for this one.
The last God of War was released to critical acclaim back in 2018 and was the winner of a ton of awards, so it’s no surprise that a sequel is on the way and fans are losing their minds over its announcement.
Here’s everything we know so far about the latest game in the God of War series. If you’re looking for news on other upcoming releases, and there are a lot of them, we have many covered ranging from Lego Star Wars to Gotham Knights to Ashes of Creation.Sony are keeping their cards close to their chest when it comes to God of War: Ragnarok but we do know a few things. For one, look for the big teased fight between Kratos and Thor to kick off in spectacular fashion when we get our hands on the game.Expect more detailed information to start being released over the coming months as the promotional campaign really kicks off- but we are eager to learn as much as we can about the much-anticipated sequel.

<h3 style="font-family:courier">New Assassin’s Creed Valhalla Gameplay Revealed at Ubisoft Forward – A Bigger Evolution Than We Thought</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana; color:orange">Ubisoft has now released extended looks at gameplay sequences from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The gameplay was revealed during the Ubisoft Forward conference, giving us a first look at the game’s new combat mechanics, fort raids, and more. We also got a good look at the expanded RPG elements, Viking rap battles, enlisting cats onto your clan, and more combat changes than we could count.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla will continue to expand upon the RPG mechanics from Odyssey. The game is set in the Viking era in 873 AD. Players will get to control Eivor who leads his/her clan against the opposing rulers of England.

But before we get into Valhalla’s gameplay details, I’m concerned about a few things. Let’s address the elephant in the room here – we arguably got more information from last week’s Valhalla gameplay leak over this new sequence. I don’t know why the official gameplay trailer is so shoddily edited. It’s almost like Ubisoft thought people will tune out if there’s not a cinematic camera cut every 3 seconds. Thankfully though, the extended 30 minute Valhalla gameplay video is a little easier to digest.Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is Ubisoft’s biggest Assassin’s Creed game, with over 15 studios engaged in development. It was the first game in a long while to be revealed with a CGI trailer. However, everything revealed since then had been a little underwhelming, until today.

<h3>The 4 biggest announcements from Ubisoft Forward</h3>
<p style="color:black;font-family:verdana">Ubisoft, like many other video game companies, was unable to host its typical in-person press conference at E3 in June due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it hosted a digital event on Sunday called “Ubisoft Forward,” revealing more about its biggest upcoming games. Those included Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Watch Dogs: Legion, its newly-announced battle royale shooter Hyper Scape, Far Cry 6, and more. The company says it also plans to hold another Ubisoft Forward showcase later this year.

Ubisoft Forward comes at a difficult time for the company: Reports of a pervasive toxic culture at Ubisoft have recently come to light amid multiple allegations of misconduct levied against Ubisoft employees. Just yesterday, three prominent executives left Ubisoft, bringing the total to four departures (and one additional suspension) since the allegations were made public.And that was it for Ubisoft Forward. We got some pretty decent announcements and the long-awaited gameplay footage for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. If these announcements felt too short and lacking, then fear not. Ubisoft has announced that they will be holding a second digital event sometime in the near future. You can check out the entire Ubisoft Forward presentation, which includes the 30-minute long in-depth gameplay for Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla as part of the post-show, at the bottom of this article. Similarly, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, Electronic Arts and Nacon also had their respective presentations, which were all held in association with the Summer Game Fest. Additionally, feel free to sign up to Summer Game Fest here, to stay up to date with all the upcoming gaming events as and when they pop up.
