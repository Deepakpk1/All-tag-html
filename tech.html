<h3 style="font-family:courier">Spotify Hits 138 Million Paid Subscribers as Music Streaming Demand Rebounds</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana; color:rgb(206, 226, 21)">Spotify Technology said on Wednesday music streaming demand had rebounded from coronavirus-related weakness at the start of the quarter and its paid subscribers reached 138 million, ahead of Wall Street estimates.

However, the company's quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimates, hit mostly by a 21 percent fall in ad-supported revenue as the spread of the pandemic kept advertisers at bay.

Shares of the Swedish company, which have risen about 80 percent since the beginning of this year, fell 3 percent to $253 (roughly Rs. 18,900) before the market open.

Spotify, which leads the market for music streaming ahead of rivals such as Apple and Amazon, earns from paid subscriptions and by showing ads to non-paying users.

Premium subscribers, which account for most of the company's revenue, were up 27 percent from a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting the company to have 136.4 million paid subscribers, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The world's largest music streaming service also assuaged investors that people no longer commuting to work would not have a deep lasting impact on its finances and it will hit its full-year targets.

Strength in North America and other areas more than offset the slow start to the quarter and the improved momentum in the back half of the quarter has continued into the third quarter, the company said in a statement.

It expects total premium subscribers in the range of 140 million to 144 million for the third quarter, above expectations of 141.4 million.

<h3> style= Apple App Store Chief Phil Schiller Says Brand Aimed to Level Playing Field for Developers</h3>
<p style="color:white;font-family:verdana">On Wednesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook will face questions from US lawmakers about whether the iPhone maker's App Store practices give it unfair power over independent software developers.

Apple tightly controls the App Store, which forms the centerpiece of its $46.3 billion-per-year (roughly Rs. 3.46 lakh crores) services business. Developers have criticised Apple's commissions of between 15 percent and 30 percent on many App Store purchases, its prohibitions on courting customers for outside signs-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.

But when the App Store launched in 2008 with 500 apps, Apple executives viewed it as an experiment in offering a compellingly low commission rate to attract developers, Philip W Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing and top executive for the App Store, told Reuters in an interview.

"One of the things we came up with is, we're going to treat all apps in the App Store the same - one set of rules for everybody, no special deals, no special terms, no special code, everything applies to all developers the same. That was not the case in PC software. Nobody thought like that. It was a complete flip around of how the whole system was going to work," Schiller said.

In the mid-2000s, software sold through physical stores involved paying for shelf space and prominence, costs that could eat 50 percent of the retail price, said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies. Small developers could not break in.

Bajarin said the App Store's predecessor was Handango, a service that around 2005 let developers deliver apps over cellular connections to users' Palm and other devices for a 40 percent commission.

With the App Store, "Apple took that to a whole other level. And at 30 percent, they were a better value,‚Äù Bajarin said.

But the App Store had rules: Apple reviewed each app and mandated the use of Apple's own billing system. Schiller said Apple executives believed users would feel more confident buying apps if they felt their payment information was in trusted hands.

"We think our customers' privacy is protected that way. Imagine if you had to enter credit cards and payments to every app you've ever used," he said.

Apple's rules started as an internal list but were published in 2010.
